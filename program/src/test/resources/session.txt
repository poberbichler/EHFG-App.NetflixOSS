&lt;strong&gt;Urban environments and NCDs&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Engaging multiples stakeholders and sustainable environments to nurture a life free from NCDs&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With cities as the entry point, the aim of this workshop is to explore future innovative solutions to the rising health costs and social burden of NCDs.&lt;br /&gt;
Given the growing population density and diversification of cities in Europe over the coming decades, and the growing burden of NCDs, which already account for 50% of the disease burden worldwide, health systems are under increased pressure. At the same time cities represent a unique access point for identifying multi-stakeholder solutions to the societal challenges presented by these diseases.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We intend to examine the following specific areas within the context of the city environment and the different roles of multiple actors in NCD responses:&lt;br /&gt;
- how to promote health literacy;&lt;br /&gt;
- how to reduce the impact of the marketing of unhealthy foods and non-alcoholic beverages to children;&lt;br /&gt;
- how to produce and promote more food products consistent with a healthy diet;&lt;br /&gt;
- how to promote and create an enabling environment for healthy behaviours among workers and&lt;br /&gt;
- how to reduce inequity in the prevention and control of NCDs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We will also analyse examples of how cities can serve as the perfect microcosm for bringing together the local government, private sector, NGOs and academia for population-based NCD responses.&lt;/p&gt;
